# osuDB
Project I made so that anyone can have easy access to the 170k+ ranked maps currently in osu. Used in conjunction with [osdbParser](https://github.com/JonathanJia05/osdbParser) to create the json files from .osdb files to be processed. 

## Setup

### 1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OsdbParser.git
cd osdbParser
```
